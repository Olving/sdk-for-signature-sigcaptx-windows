# React Samples for SigCaptX

## Download the SDK

Please see the GETTING-STARTED document in the home folder for instructions on installing the Signature SDK and SigCaptX library and licence.

## Download NodeJS

Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.  The latest release at time of writing (July 2020) is 12.18.2.  

## Install the React sample code

1. Extract the SigCaptX React sample code to your chosen directory.  This should create a folder and directory structure as follows:

```
				React/sigcaptx/
				React/sigcaptx/public/
				React/sigcaptx/public/images/
				React/sigcaptx/public/nodejs/
				React/sigcaptx/src/
				
				React/sigcaptx-wiz/
				React/sigcaptx-wiz/public/
				React/sigcaptx-wiz/public/images/
				React/sigcaptx-wiz/src/
```

2. Start a command prompt and change directory to the sigcaptx folder which was created

3. Run “npm install” (see note 1 below).  

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the sigcaptx-wiz folder  


## Start the NodeJS server and run the sample

To test either of the samples, change directory to the appropriate project folder and type “npm start”.
This should open up the sample automatically in your default browser.

Alternatively enter http://localhost:3000/ from your chosen browser.
